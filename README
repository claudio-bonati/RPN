** ENERGY
*****************************************************

This partition function is

Z = exp( \beta * \sum_{x,\mu} [ phi_{x}^t\cdot \phi_{x+\mu} ]^2 )

where \phi_{x} are R^N vectors associated to sites which satisfy the constraint
\|\phi_{x}\|=1.

For the ferromagnetic (\beta>0) case this action can be rewritten as

Z=exp(\sum_{x,\mu} [ - U_{x,\mu}^2/beta + 2 U_{x,\mu} * phi_{x}^t\cdot \phi_{x+\mu} ] )

where U_{x,\mu} are real numbers associated to links.

** CONFIGURE PARAMETERS
*****************************************************

The value of N is fixed at configure time by the macro N_f so that to simulate
the RP^4 model one has to use 

./configure Gauge_Group=SuN N_f=5

The following macro are availbale

N_f         the number of flavours (default 2)
Num_threads number of threads to be used in OpenMP (default 1)
ST_dim      spacetime dimensionality (default 2)

and the use of OpenMP can by activated by using 

--enable-use-openmp     to enable the use of openmp

After the configuration, the compilation is performed as usual by
make

Defining the macro DEBUG several sanity checks are activated, which can
slow-down the algorithm.

Calling the executable without input file the configuration options are shown
and the template file "template_input.in" is produced.


** INPUT FILE AND SOME CONVENTIONS
*****************************************************

A template input file is created when calling the executable without input file
and everything following # (up to carriage return) in the input file is
interpreted as a comment.

** OBSERVABLES
*****************************************************

The data file produced consists of an header first line (with written the
space-time dimension and the lattice sizes) and a sequence of lines each
composed of two columns.

Let the N_fxN_f symmetric traceless matrix Q be defined by

Q_{ij} = \phi_i \phi_j - (1/N_f) \delta_{ij} (\sum_a \phi_a \phi_a)

or by its staggered analogue for the anti-ferromagnetic \beta<0 case. In the
first column of the output file the value

Tr[(\sum_x Q_x)(\sum_y Q_y)]/volume

is written, which is the magnetic suceptibility. In the second column 
the value of 

ReTr[(\sum_x Q_xe^{ipx})(\sum_y Q_ye^{-ipy)]/volume

is printed, where p=(0, 2*pi/L_1, 0, ... 0) is the minumum momentum in
direction 1. This value can be used to extract the second momentum correlation
length.
