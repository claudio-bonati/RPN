** ENERGY

This partition function is

Z = exp( \beta * \sum_{x,\mu} [ phi_{x}^t\cdot \phi_{x+\mu} ]^2 )

where \phi_{x} are R^N vectors associated to sites which satisfy the constraint
\|\phi_{x}\|=1.

For the ferromagnetic (\beta>0) case this action can be rewritten as

Z=exp(\sum_{x,\mu} [ - U_{x,\mu}^2/beta + 2 U_{x,\mu} * phi_{x}^t\cdot \phi_{x+\mu} ] )

where U_{x,\mu} are real numbers associated to links.

** CONFIGURE PARAMETERS
*****************************************************

The value of N is fixed at configure time by the macro N_f so that to simulate
the RP^4 model one has to use 

./configure Gauge_Group=SuN N_f=5

The following macro are availbale

N_f         the number of flavours (default 2)
Num_threads number of threads to be used in OpenMP (default 1)
ST_dim      spacetime dimensionality (default 2)

and the use of OpenMP can by activated by using 

--enable-use-openmp     to enable the use of openmp


After the configuration, the compilation is performed as usual by
make

Defining the macro DEBUG several sanity checks are activated, which can
slow-down the algorithm.


** INPUT FILE AND SOME CONVENTIONS
*****************************************************

A template input file is created when calling the executable without input file
and everything following # (up to carriage return) in the input file is
interpreted as a comment.
